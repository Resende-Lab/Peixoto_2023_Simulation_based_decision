This is a repository with the scripts of the paper: 
Simulation Based Decision Making and Implementation of Tools in Hybrid Crop Breeding Pipelines

DOI: ...


### Content

**Parental_update folder**: This folder contains the script for running the first question of the manuscript: which is the best strategy to update the crossing block at each cycle?
Four scenarios were implemented:

i. CONV: Conventional breeding program (phenotypic selection) with parents of the new cycle coming from the top ranked individuals at the first testcross.
ii. CONVe: Conventional breeding program (phenotypic selection) with parents of the new cycle selected from the top ranked individuals in F3/F5 populations.
iii. GS: Genomic selection breeding program with parents of the new cycle coming from the top ranked individuals at the first testcross.
iv. GSe: Genomic selection breeding program with parents of the new cycle selected from the top ranked individuals in F3/F5 populations.

**HTP_vs_GS folder**: This folder has the script for the second question of the paper: the feasibility of implementation of genomic selection and high-throughput phenotyping in a hybrid breeding program.

Four scenarios were evaluated (all with early selection, i.e., parents of the new cycle selected from the top ranked individuals in F3/F5 populations):

i. CONVe: Conventional breeding program. 
ii. CONVe_HTP: conventional breeding program with high-throughput phenotyping. 
iii. GSe: conventional breeding program with genomic selection. 
iv. GSe_HTP: conventional breeding program with genomic selection and high-throughput phenotyping.

**Plot folder**: This folder contains a script to plot the graphs as an outcome of the analyses.

Any question regard the analyses, please, contact me!
